# finalprojectV1_Lersch

I genuinely am not sure where I went wrong with this project because it was going very smooth when I was trying to catch up.  As I had stated in my recent email I have been struggling with a family crisis and that has been my focus.  Becuase of this I was not able to develop this project to near the extent which I believe I could have and it does not meet the requirements of the final project.  For this reason I am sorry, and I am turning it what I was able to complete.

Completed Portions -
* I developed what I feel is a fairly nice front end with two pages for users to use
* I was able to develop some functionality of the buttons (however it was ruined when the database implementation began)
* The database was created with functionality for use (even though lacking connection with the HTML for getting data)
* I was able to create data populators for my database and add various amounts of data.

Failures -
To prefice my list of failures I wanted to state that my primary struggle was my inablity to obtain data from the database to use within the website.  Because of this I was unable to create basically any functionality for users.  I'm not sure where I went wrong because I looked through the course material and could find no solution.  I then turned to a friend who has some development experience however he was unable to solve the issues with the modules I was meant to use.  Overall I am upset, fed up with myself and occupied with my family issues and I am sorry for my poor work.

* Could not pull data from data base in order to implement functionality of data within the website.
  - Failed to implement player profile search functionality
  - Failed to implement task generation
* Destroyed my work which simulated some functionality if there was database access.

I know this is our final project and it is worth a significant portion of our grade, I also know I havent been the best student.  Because of this I ask that you take it easy on me as this is the last class in which I need to graduate from my primary university.  I only need to recieve a C in the course and I know my work is very subpar but if you are willing to give me the help I need to move forward with my life it would mean an extremly large amount.
