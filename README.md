# finalprojectV1_Lersch

I genuinely am not sure where I went wrong with this project because it was going very smooth when I was trying to catch up. As I had stated in my recent email I have been struggling with a family crisis and that has been my focus. Becuase of this I was not able to develop this project to near the extent which I believe I could have and it does not meet the requirements of the final project. For this reason I am sorry, and I am turning it what I was able to complete.

Completed Portions:

* I developed what I feel is a fairly nice front end with two pages for users to use.
* I was able to develop some functionality for the buttons, however, this was compromised when database implementation began.
* The database was created with functionality for use, though it lacked connection with the HTML for retrieving data.
* I was able to create data populators for my database and add various amounts of data.

Failures -
Failures - To preface my list of failures, I want to state that my primary struggle was my inability to obtain data from the database for use within the website. Because of this, I was unable to create much functionality for users. I'm not sure where I went wrong, as I reviewed the course material and could find no solution. I then turned to a friend with some development experience; however, he was unable to resolve the issues with the modules I was meant to use. Overall, I am upset, fed up with myself, and preoccupied with my family issues, and I am sorry for the poor quality of my work.

* Could not pull data from database in order to implement functionality of data within the website.
  - Failed to implement player profile search functionality
  - Failed to implement task generation
* Destroyed my work which simulated some functionality if there was database access.

I know this is our final project and it is worth a significant portion of our grade. I also acknowledge that I haven't been the best student. Because of this, I ask that you consider my situation as this is the last class I need to graduate from my primary university. I only need to receive a C in the course. Although I know my work is subpar, any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated and would mean a great deal to me..
